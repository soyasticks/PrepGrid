## 📌 Project Overview

PrepGrid is a full-stack placement preparation platform that helps engineering students crack technical interviews through AI-driven mock interviews, in-browser coding practice, timed quizzes, and personalised performance tracking.

The platform mirrors the real interview experience — an AI interviewer asks role-specific questions, evaluates your answers in real time, scores each response out of 10, and gives actionable feedback. The quiz module generates topic-specific MCQs on demand, with a live leaderboard tracking top scorers. The code editor supports 4 languages with Judge0-powered execution.
